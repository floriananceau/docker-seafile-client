Hello everyone,

I wanted to use files from my Seafile server within Docker containers.

I started looking for existing image featuring a Seafile client on Docker Hub. There are some, but with issues such as non-existant/vague documentation or improper tagging.

I don't know if it's something that people are looking for, but I made one. It's available at flowgunso/seafile-client in Docker Hub.

Example usage with docker-compose and for the docker cli are provided. Essentially, it runs `seaf-cli sync`, but you have to pass to the container your Seafile server URL, your credentials and the library ID you want to sync with. Then you can share the path `/library` as a volume to your containers for your own usages.

Feedback is welcome so I can keep improving it.
