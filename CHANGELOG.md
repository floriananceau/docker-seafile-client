### [1.2.1] - 2019/05/02
- Fix #4:
  - Switch base image from Debian oldoldstable Jessie to Debian stable Buster to fix unmet dependencies of `seafile-cli` to `python-future` and `python-searpc`
  - Replace `;` with `&&` as commands separators in the Dockerfile's `RUN` to properly report failed commands at CI

## [1.2.0] - 2019/05/02
- Replace _supervisord_ with _cron_ for running the front job that keeps the container up. It uses less resources.
- Improve the __infinite-seaf-cli-start.sh__ into __seafile-healthcheck.sh__. The Seafile daemon will not be restarted if it's state are either _downloading_ or _committing_, which otherwise is problematic.

- Slim down the Docker image, from 102MB to 67MB, gaining 35MB, reducing size by 34%.
### [1.1.1] - 2019/04/18
- Because of the infinite-seaf-cli-start loop, within the container was running many seaf-daemons. Now, the infinite loop stop the current seaf-daemon before starting it again. (see #3)
## [1.1.0] - 2019/04/09
- The container now actually use the UID/GID provided to it:  
The container entrypoint is run with root, then another entrypoint is run by the container's user, seafuser, to run the Seafile client.
